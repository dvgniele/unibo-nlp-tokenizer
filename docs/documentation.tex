To support the Italian language, the default configuration of the tokenizer supports all the letters available for Italian, including accented ones: \textit{à è é ì ò ù}
\section{Punctuation}
There are two rules for Italian punctuation, one including all the punctuations, and a second one (placed right before the generic one) to support exclusively the "..." punctuation.

\chapter{Domain Support}
At the time, since almost every person has a email address, that's why there is a dedicated tokenization rule to tokenize emails. Email domain is not the only kind of domain supported, indeed there is also the support for classic URLs
